## Presenting an Income Statement

1. **Single-step IS** - All revenues and gains are presented first, followed by all expenses and losses. The difference is computed and subjected to income tax to get the net income.
2. **Multi-step IS** - several steps are taken before we could arrive at the net income
	- Gross Profit
	- Total Operating Expenses
	- Operating Income
	- Income before Tax
	- Net Income
$$

-  Cost\,of\,Sales
=
   Gross\,Profit
-  Expenses =
   Net\,Income/Profit
