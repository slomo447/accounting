## Underlying Accounting Concepts and Assumptions

Business Entity Concept
limits the economic data in the accounting system to data related directly to the acitivities of the business
The unit-of-measure concept requires that economic data be recorded in peso.
The objectivity concept requires that the accounting records and reports be based upon objective evidence.
The cost concept is the basis for entering the exchange price, or cost of an acquisition in the accounting records. 
Going concern assumes that in the evidence to the contrary, a business entity has an indefinite life (business exists indefinitely once started)
  •  Accounting period concept requires the result of operation and financial position be measured at relatively short intervals (business life is broken to intervals, prepare financial staments in every intervals of time)
