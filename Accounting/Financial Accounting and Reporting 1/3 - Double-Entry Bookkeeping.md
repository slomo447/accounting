A business entity has TWO Books of Accounts

| Journal                                                       | Ledger                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Book of Original Entry                                        | Book of Final Entry                                              |
| \- is a **chronological** record of all financial transaction | \- A group of accounts for a business entity is called a ledger. |

## Journal 
Book of Original Entry
\- is a **chronological** record of all financial transactions

## Account
- Each element of the Accounting equation has smaller sub-elements called accounts
- Account is the detailed record of all increases and decreases that have occurred in an individual asset, liability, equity, revenue or expense during a specified period

Each item in the financial statements is called an **account**

## Major Classifications
### Assets
are resources owned and controlled by the business
- Cash
- accounts receivable 
- Notes receivable 
- Inventories
- Supplies
- Building
- Land
### Liabilities
are debts owed to outsiders (creditors)
- Accounts Payable 
- Notes Payable
- Interest Payable
- Wages Payable
- Utilities Payable
- Unearned Income
### Owner’s equity 
is the owner’s right to the assets of the business.
- Clark, Capital
- Clark, Drawing
### Revenues 
are increases in owner’s equity as a result of selling services or products.
- Fees Earned
- Fares Earned
- Commission Revenue
- Tuition Fee Income
- Sales Revenue
### Expenses 
are the using up of assets or consuming of services to generate revenue. 
- Rent Expense
- Salaries Expense
- Utilities Expense
- Supplies Expense
- Wages Expense
- Depreciation Expense

### Two Types of Accounts

| Statement of Financial Position         | Statement of Income                |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| REAL accounts/PERMANENT account         | NOMINAL accounts/TEMPORARY account |
| LIABILITIES<br>OWNER’S EQUITY<br>ASSETS | REVENUES<br>EXPENSES               |

## Ledger
Book of Final Entry
\- A group of accounts for a business entity is called a ledger.

> [!note]+
> Each account title MUST have at least one ledger

The “table of contents” of the Ledger is called CHART OF ACCOUNTS

Therefore, a chart of accounts is a list of the account titles to be used by the business entity.

## Account
a title of a specific sub-element of the accounting equation
> [!note]+ Therefore
> a device used by accountants to record the increases or decreases in the specific sub-element of the accounting equation

## The T-account has a title.
- The left side of the account is the debit side
- The right side of the account is the credit side
- The T-account resembles a ledger
## Accounting Cycle
1. Documentation
2. Journalizing
3. Posting
4. Trial Balance
5. Worksheet 6. Financial Statements
6. Adjusting entries
7. Closing entries
8. Post-closing Trial Balance
9. Reversing entries
## Step 2: Journalizing

Transactions that affect Statement of Financial Position

|                                  | Debits       | Credits      |
| -------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Asset Account                    | Increase (+) | Decrease (-) |
| Liability Account                | Decrease (-) | Increase (+) |
| Owner's Equity (Capital Account) | Decrease (-) | Increase (+) |
|                                  |              |              |
> [!note]+
> In every entry the sum of the debits always equal the sum of the credits.

Transactions that affect Statement of Income

|                 | Debits       | Credits      |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Revenue Account | Decrease (-) | Increase (+) |
| Expense Account | Increase (+) | Decrease (-) |

## Double-Entry Accounting
“ Double-entry accounting is based on a simple concept: each party in a business transaction
will receive something and give something in return. In bookkeeping terms, what is received
is a debit and what is given is a credit. The T account is a representation of a scale or balance.”

**Flow of Business Transactions**
1. Transaction authorized 
2. Transaction takes place 
3. Document prepared
4. Entry recorded in journal
5. Entry posted to ledger

**System to Analyze Transactions**
1. Determine whether an asset, a liability, owner’s equity, revenue, or expense account is affected by the transaction.
2. For each account affected by the transaction, determine whether the account increases or decreases.
3. Determine whether each increase or decrease should be recorded as a debit or a credit

## Step 3: Posting
Refer to ppt haha

## Step 4: Trial Balance
The primary purpose of the trial balance is to prove the mathematical equality of the debits and credits after posting. The amounts come from the individual account balances in the General Ledger.

**Errors that will NOT cause the trial balance to be unequal:**

1. Failure to record a transaction or to post a transaction.
2. Recording the same erroneous amount for both the debit and the credit parts of a transaction.
3. Recording the same transaction more than once.
4. Posting a part of a transaction correctly as a debit or credit but to the wrong account.

**Correction of Errors**

| Error                                              | Correcting Procedure                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Journal entry is incorrect                      | Draw a line through the error<br>but not posted. and insert correct title or<br>amount. |
| 2. Journal entry is correct but posted incorrectly | Draw a line through the posted error and post<br>correctly<br>                          |
| 3. Journal entry is incorrect                      | Journalize and post a<br>and posted correcting entry                                    |

> [!question]+
> After journalizing, posting and trial balance, are we ready to prepare the Financial Statements?
> **DEFINETLY NO!!!**
