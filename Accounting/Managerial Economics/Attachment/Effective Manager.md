## 1. Identify goals and constraints
## 2. Recognize the Importance of Profits

### **Accounting Profits** 
$$Capital-Cost$$
### **Economic Profits**
$$Total\,Revenue - Total\,Opportunity\,Cost$$
Opportunity cost actual cost of resource giving up the best alternative use of resources 

> [!NOTE] Principle
> **Profits are a Signal:**
> Profits signals to resource holders where resources are most highly valued by society

## 3. Understand Incentives
## 4. Understand Markets
- **Consumer-Producer Rivalry** - consumers negotiate for lower prices, producers requests for higher prices
			- Examples: Supermarket
- **Consumer-Consumer Rivalry** - limited quantities of goals are available, consumers compete
			- Examples: Tuna fish market
- **Producer-Producer Rivalry** - customers are scarce, producers compete with one another for the rights of service
		- Example: Markets at sales
- **Government and Market** - consumer/producer finds themselves a **disadvantage** in the market, they attempt to induce the government
## 5. Recognize the True Value of Money

the fact that peso today is worth more than one peso received in the future

| Values                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PV = Present Value<br>FV = Future Value<br>i = rate of interest<br>n = time period |

### Present Value
$$PV = \frac {FV}{(1 + i)^t}$$
### Present Value Analysis
$$ PV = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{FV}{(1+i)^t}
$$
### Net Present Value (NPV)
present value of the income stream generated by a project minus the current cost

$$NPV = \frac{FV_1}{(1+i)^i} + \frac{FV_2}{(1+i)^2} + \frac{FV_3}{(1+i)^3} + \cdots + \frac{FV_n}{(1+i)^n} - C_o$$
$C_o$ = Capital

### Perpetuity Present Value
$$PV_{{perpetuity}} = \frac {CF}{(1+i)} + \frac {CF}{(1+i)^2} + \cdots$$
$$= \frac {CF}{i}$$
### Present Value of Firm
present value of it stream of profits
$$PV_{{firm}}=\pi_0 + \frac{\pi_1}{(1+i)} + \frac{\pi_2}{(1+i)^2} + \frac{\pi_3}{(1+i)^3} + \cdots$$


> [!NOTE] Principle
> Maximum profits mean maximum the  value of the fir, present value at current and future profits
