- a quantitative approach that determines the sales volume and mix of products required
    - Break-even analysis: determines point at which total costs and revenues are equal; contains formula and graph & margin of safety

Significance
helps manager understand interrelationship among cost, volume, & profit by focusing on interactions and relationships of following elements with each other:
- price of product
-  volume of sales
-  variable costs per unit
- total fixed cost
- product mix  
- useful in determining the level of sales needed to achieve a desired level of profit
  
### Assumptions / Limitations
- The analysis is valid for limited range of values and limited period of time
- All costs are classified as fixed & variable costs
- The fixed cost remains constant within the relevant ranger
- The variable cost changes in proposition to the changes of activity levels
- The product mix is considered constant
- Inventories do not change insignificantly
- The business operates under normal operating conditions
- The analysis is deterministic and appropriate data can be found
