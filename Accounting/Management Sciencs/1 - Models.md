### Definitions
- Mathematical / quantitative methods for business decision making
- Study of problem-solving and decision-making in organizations    
- Scientific approach used to determine management problems and economic decisions using quantitative tools    
- Used interchangeably with “operations research”, “quantitative analysis”, and “decision science

### Nature, Scope, Objective
- Interdisciplinary field that uses mathematical modelling, statistical analysis, and optimization techniques
- Focuses on the use of quantitative methods to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of operations in various industries
- **Main objective:** to find the best possible solutions to real world problems

> [!note]+
> Management science plays a crucial role in enhancing the **efficiency & effectiveness** of business and organizations, helping them make better decisions and allocate resources

1. Identify & define the problem
2. Determine alternative solutions
3. Determine criteria to be used for evaluating alternatives
4. Evaluate the alternatives
5. Choose an alternative
6. Implement the selected alternative
7. Evaluate the results to determine whether a satisfactory solution has been obtained 

> [!note]+ Problem Solving
>  identifying difference between actual and desired state of affairs then taking actions to resolve the difference

> [!note]+ Decision Making
>  generally associated with the first 5 steps of problem-solving process
>  - Structuring the problem: steps 1-3
>  - Analyzing: steps 4-5

## Characteristics:
- Primarily intended to solve management problems
- Uses quantitative tools in finding solutions to management problems
- Observe assumptions inherent in particular quantitative tool
- Does not violate constraints / limitations of particular quantitative model

### History 
- **Early 20th century:** initial development
- **World War II:** former developments of several management science
- **Post-WWII Era:** emergence of several nonmilitary management science applications
	- Simplex Method (1940s)
	- First operation research textbook (1950s)
-  Computer technology continues to play an integral role

	
process of solving management problems using scientific approach
### Steps 
1. Define the problem
2. Develop mathematical mode
3. Gather input data
4. Develop a solution
5. Test the solution
6. Analyze and evaluate the result
7. Implement the results

### Benefits of Mathematical Modelling

- Can accurately represent reality
- Help a decision maker formulate problems
- Gives us information and insights
- Saves time and money in decision & problem solving
- Maybe the only way to solve some large & complex problems in timely manner
- Used to communicate problems and solutions
### Limitations 
- Members of management may have contradicting perspectives regarding a problem which could lead to resistance
- Mathematical model may be too complex / unreal
- The date collected may not be sufficient for quantitative analysis
- Quantitative analysis approach employs only quantitative data & suggest a solution based on mathematical representation
  
> [!note]+
> **Business analytics** uses a large amount of data with managerial science techniques to help managers make decision

### Management Science Tools & Techniques
- CVP (Cost Volume Profit) Analysis
- Inventory Models
- Linear programming
- Distribution & network models
- Decision theory
- Regression analysis
- Queuing theory
- PERT / CPM
- Probability Concept
- Simulation
### Mathematical model
is a representation of a problem by a system of symbols & mathematical relationships / expressions In managerial problem, problem definition phase usually leads to: 
- Specific objective (ex: profit maximization) 
- Constraints (ex: production capacity)
