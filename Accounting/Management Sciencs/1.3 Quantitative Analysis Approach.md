process of solving management problems using scientific approach
### Steps 
1. Define the problem
2. Develop mathematical mode
3. Gather input data
4. Develop a solution
5. Test the solution
6. Analyze and evaluate the result
7. Implement the results

### Benefits of Mathematical Modelling

- Can accurately represent reality
- Help a decision maker formulate problems
- Gives us information and insights
- Saves time and money in decision & problem solving
- Maybe the only way to solve some large & complex problems in timely manner
- Used to communicate problems and solutions


### Limitations 
- Members of management may have contradicting perspectives regarding a problem which could lead to resistance
- Mathematical model may be too complex / unreal
- The date collected may not be sufficient for quantitative analysis
- Quantitative analysis approach employs only quantitative data & suggest a solution based on mathematical representation
  
> [!note]+
> **Business analytics** uses a large amount of data with managerial science techniques to help managers make decision

### Management Science Tools & Techniques
