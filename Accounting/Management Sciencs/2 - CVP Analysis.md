\- a quantitative approach that determines the sales volume and mix of products required
	    - Break-even analysis: determines point at which total costs and revenues are equal; contains formula and graph & margin of safety

Significance
helps manager understand interrelationship among cost, volume, & profit by focusing on interactions and relationships of following elements with each other:
- price of product
-  volume of sales
-  variable costs per unit
- total fixed cost
- product mix  
- useful in determining the level of sales needed to achieve a desired level of profit
### Assumptions / Limitations
- The analysis is valid for limited range of values and limited period of time
- All costs are classified as fixed & variable costs
- The fixed cost remains constant within the relevant ranger
- The variable cost changes in proposition to the changes of activity levels
- The product mix is considered constant
- Inventories do not change insignificantly
- The business operates under normal operating conditions
- The analysis is deterministic and appropriate data can be found
	
## Break-Even Point
### Units
$$
\frac {Total\, Fixed\, Costs}{Contribution\, Margin(CM)\, per \, unit}
$$
### Pesos
$$
\frac {Total\, Fixed\, Costs}{Contribution\, Margin(CM)\, per \, ratio}
$$
### CM per unit
$$Unit \, Selling \, Price\, - \, Unit\, Variable\, Cost$$
### CM Ratio
$$\frac {CM\, per\,unit}{Unit\, Selling\, Price}$$

### Margin of Safety	
$$Actual\, Sales - BE\, Sales$$

## Break-Even Graph
### Steps
1. Plot volume on the horizontal line
2. Plot sales revenue, variable costs, and fixed costs on vertical line
3. Break-even point is the curve where the total revenue line intersects the total cost line analysis approach

### Quantitative Analysis Approach:

- process of solving management problems
    - Steps:Â 
    1. Identify and define the problem
    2. Develop a mathematical model
    3. Gather quantitative data
    4. Develop a solution
    5. Test the solution
    6. Analyze and evaluate the results


## Additional
### Cost Volume Model
$$ C(x) = Fixed \,Cost(FC) + Variable\, Cost(VC) (x)$$
   - ex: C(x) = 150,000 + 100x

### Revenue Volume Model
$$R(x) = Target\, price (x)$$
- R(x) = 250(x)
### Profit Model
$$P(x) = R(x) - C(x)$$
- ex: P(x) = 250x - (100,000 + 100x)
